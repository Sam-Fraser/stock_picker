This is a stock picker program created using Ruby.  The project description can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/stock-picker

Description:
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0. 

How to run:
Run in your command line by typing $ ruby stock_picker.rb
You can change the array in the the stock_picker.rb file to anything you want and it will still work.
